    "Pros:\n",
    "    1. Tackes the overfitting issue.\n",
    "    2. Adaboost handles missing values.\n",
    "    3. Very good when the data is low biased & high variance.\n",
    "    4. It has a few numbers of parameters also to tune.\n",
    "    5. Doesnt require feature scaliing\n",
    "    \n",
    "cons:\n",
    "    1. For regression it doesn't perform that well.\n",
    "    2. Time complexity & memory storage is high.\n",
    "    3. It is complex compared to other algorithms.\n",
    "    4. Adaboost is sensitive to outliers.\n",

    "Difference between Bagging & Boosting Algos:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Bagging:\n",
    "    1. The weak learners (trees) are connected in parallel to each other. (Parallel approch)\n",
    "    2. Bootstrap is used as resampling stategy.\n",
    "    3. Resampling is done not on the basis on weights assigned.\n",
    "    4. Variours data sets for every learner is randommly drawn from the original data. & they have no dependencies.\n",
    "    5. Bagging is used to mainly for overfittingng issues.\n",
    "    6. Every model is assigned equal weight.\n",
    "    7. Every model is constructed indepndently.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Boosting:\n",
    "    1. The weak learners (trees) are connected in Series to each other. (Sequential approch)\n",
    "    2. Sampling is done based such that any random number is chosen & to whichever weight that number belongs that sample is chosen. However same sample is repeated multiple times beacause of high weights.\n",
    "    3. Resampling is done based on assigned weights.\n",
    "    4. There lies a data dependency of any learner on its previous learner.\n",
    "    5. boosting is good for both overfitting & underfitting. Adaboost does good for overfitting issue & GBoost & XGBoost are good for underfittingerfitting issue.\n",
    "    6. Models are weighted by their preformance.\n",
    "    7. New modelels are affected by the performance of the previous model."
