    "Advantages:\n",
    "    1. Less effort for data preparation during pre processing.\n",
    "    2. Does not require normalization / scaling.\n",
    "    3. Missing Values does not affect the growth of the tree. Decision tree uses thresold split for handeling missing values.\n",
    "    4. Impact of outlier is negligible.\n",
    "    5. This is very intuitive & easy to explain.\n",
    "    6. It has the facility of visualization. one can see the tree model that has been build.\n",
    "    7. This concept is familiar with most of the programers.\n",
    "    8. scope of parametric tuning is high ; There are several parametres to tune.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "    1. It always trends to overfit making the predicts on test sample poor.\n",
    "    2. The time complexity of the model is really high. specially when we have large sample data size.\n",
    "    3. for smaller data, it mugg ups the data >> overfits.\n",
    "    4. If we at data even a single observation at any random point of time, then the whole structure of the tree may change.\n",
    "    5. Compared to other algorithms, the addition of features increases the computational time & complexity.\n",
    "    6. Regression model is not very accurate specially when tree is prunned or max depth is set.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Applications:\n",
    "    1. Customer segmentation\n",
    "    2. Invetory management\n",
    "    3. Customer Retention & customer churn.\n",
    "    4. Medical, patient disorder classification.\n",
    "    5. Used by companies for promotional campeign, marketing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Impactct of outliers & null values:\n",
    "    they do not impact the model performance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Assuptions:\n",
    "    initally the whole population is considered as root node."
